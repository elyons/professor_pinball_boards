# Professor Pinball's FM1608-120-PG to 6116 adaptor board

This board lets you use FM1608-120-PG NVRAM (28-pin) in a board that has 6116 (24-pin) RAM.  
This board was designed for a Williams System 11A board (Pinbot) to let me use NVRAM rather than batteries.
Just remove old RAM (U25), add a chip socket, and install board with NVRAM.  No other changes to 
the System 11A board was needed.

Gerber files are for SEEED Studio (just send the .zip file to have boards made).
Board files are for Eagle
